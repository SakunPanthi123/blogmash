      Thank you for coming to this app. The blogmash from the 4th semester was a great success. I thought it would be a good idea to continue the tradition and make a new blogmash completely from scratch. And this time using Next.js. 
      I hope you like the look of the new blogmash. The code for this app is available on my github. Every day, I will be adding new features to this app. The end goal is to make an app that is as feature rich as the original blogmash. So in that vein, this must also have
      things like authentication, multiple users, a way to add comments to the blogs, like the blogs, share the blogs, add images to the blogs, and so on. At the end, just like the original blogmash, it would be great to top it off with a chat feature.
      But for right now, I am just as happy to have this app up and running. I hope you enjoy it.
